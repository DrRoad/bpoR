# Bayesian Portfolio Optimization in R

## Project Description

An implementation of several Bayesian estimators for the parameters in a classic Markowitz portfolio optimization algorithm. A Gibbs sampler is used to find the Bayesian estimates.

The package accompanies a paper that was published in the Central Asian Business Journal

### Paper Abstract

Bayesian estimation techniques are proposed to find the parameters for a minimum variance portfolio within the Markowitz framework. Mo- tivation for this method comes from a series of scenarios relating to an analystâ€™s confidence in the generalizability of very recent stock data. The paper posits that an optimal stock allocation relies on a balance between recent and long-term stock behavior. The usage of prior distributions for the parameters allows for this balance. Monte Carlo sampling techniques are used to validate results.
